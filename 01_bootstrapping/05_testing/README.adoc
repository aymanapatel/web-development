== Unit Testing Decisions

1. Framework (Mocha)
2. Assertion Library (Chai)
3. Helper Libraries (JSDOM)
4. Where to run tests (Node)
5. Where to place tests (Alongside)
6. When to run tests (Upon save)

=== 1. Framework


- https://github.com/mochajs/mocha[Mocha]

Mocha is more configurable than Jasmine

- https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine[Jasmine]

- https://github.com/substack/tape[Tape]

    - Simple and minimal
    - Very simple API that doesn't require globals, or monkey patching objects for assertions.
    
- https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit[QUnit]
    - Testing framework for jQuery

- https://github.com/avajs/ava[AVA]
    - New, runs **PARALLEL TESTS**
    
- https://github.com/facebook/jest[Jest]
    - Part of React community.
    - Wrapper over Jasmine, making it suitable for versatile usage.

=== 2. Assertion Library

Declare what you expect.
Mocha doesn't come with Assertions(Others do), so need to incorporate outside library.
- Chai
    - Best
    
- Should.js

=== 3. Helper Libraries

1. JSDOM
- Run DOM-related test without server
2. Cheerio
- Query virtual DOM using jQuery selectors

=== 4. Where to run tests
1. Browsers
- Karma, Testem
2. Headless browser (Browser without UI.)
- PhantomJS (Runs V8 engine).
3. In-memory DOM
- JSDOM (Faster htan PhantomJS)

=== 5. Where to place tests

|===
| Centralized  | Alongside(Use this)

|  Less "noise" in src folder | Imports are easier since no lengthy directories
| Can remove in deployment if you want to | Clear visibility within Folder
|   |  Convenient to open
|No recreating folder structure|
|===

=== 6. When to run tests
- Rapid feedback
- Facilitates TDD
- Automated = Less friction
- Increases test visibility
