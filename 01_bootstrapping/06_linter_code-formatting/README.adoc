== Linters

- JSLint
- Highly opinionated
- JSHint
- ESLint

=== Why Linting?

-  Enforce Consistency
1. GLobals
2. Trailing/ending commas
3. Curly brace position
-  Avoid Mistakes
1. Overwriting function
2. Extra paranthesis
3. Assignment in conditional statements
4. Missing defalult case in SWITCH STATEMENT
5. Accidental console.log

=== ESLINT
ESLint is built for making your own decisions

1. Config Format?
2. Which built-in rules?
3. Warning or Errors?
4. Which plugins?
- Based on framework
5. Use preset if you can't amke your own decision?

==== 1. Config Format?



1. Seperate config file : `eslint.rc`

2. `package.json` file

- `"eslintConfig":{"plugins:["example"],"env":{"example/custom"}:true}}`

==== 2. Which built-in rules?

https://eslint.org/docs/rules/[List of available rules]

==== 3. Warning or Errors?
- Warning
1. Can continue working
2. Can be ignored
3. Team must agree: Fix warnings
- Error
1. Breaks build
2. Cannot be ignored
3. Team is forced to comply

==== 4. Which plugins?
- Based on framework : https://github.com/dustinspecler/awesome-eslint[List of ESLint configs, plugins etc]

==== 5. Use preset
If you can't make your own decision, then use a **preset**.
But remember, presets brings OPINIONETED linting.


==== Watching ESLint files

- eslint-loader
1. Re-lint all files upon save
2. Tied to **webpack**
- eslint-watch
1. Not tied to **webpack**
2. ESLint Wrapper which adds to file watch
3. Better warning/error formatting
4. Easily lints **Tests** and **build scripts**
5. Displays clean message

==== Linting experimental features

Supporting experimental JS features.
- Native ESLInt
- Supports ES5, ES6
- Supports object space
- babel-eslint
- Support experimental JS feature

==== ESLint Workflow

- ESLint recommended rules.(Can configure according to your needs)
- eslint-watch
`esw`

==== `.eslintrc.json`
`.eslintrc.json`:

- `rules.no-console:` (An example)
1. For `0` : No output
2. For `1` : Warning
3. For `2` : Error

- `.js` files
- `/*eslint-disable-line <rule>*/`
- Disable lint for that line and rule.
- `/*eslint-disabble <rule>*/`
- Disable lint for that rule

== Code Fomating

*Linting + Code Formatting = Made in Heaven*

=== Prettier

=== EditorConfig

=== Prettier vs EditorConfig

Prettier formats code on save. EditorConfig formats on cursor as you go.

=== ESLint + Prettier + EditorConfig example
