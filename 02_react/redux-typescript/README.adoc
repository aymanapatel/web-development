State Management --> Data Fetching and Caching (React Query, SWR,..)

React Redux has thus brought RTK QUery

==== Trivia

RTK query caches reseult for a minute.
To reproduce go to `XHR` in **Network tab` and use select. It will not a new create fetch request for every select, RTK is smart enough to persist in Redux store (can check in Redux devtools). 

=== History
